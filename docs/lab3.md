# Lab 3. Digital Filters

## Aim of the experiment

A goal of this experiment is to design discrete-time digital filters and implement them in real time.

In this experiment, you will design and implement finite impulse response (FIR) filters and infinite impulse response (IIR) filters in Matlab. You will measure the response of the filters using a variety of input test signals and quantify the change in magnitude response due to an increase in filter order.

## Lab report contents

Be sure to include everything listed in this section when you submit your lab report. The goal of the report is to help cement what you learned in memory. For sections I, II, and IV, imagine your audience is a student who is your peer but who has not yet completed the lab.

### I. Introduction

Briefly explain the theory and algorithms behind the programs that you wrote. The slides and reading material might help you in writing this section.

### II. Methods

Describe the steps you took to implement the algorithms in your own words.

### III. Results from lab exercise

Present the results you obtain for each task on the assignment sheet. This section should include illustrative oscilloscope screenshots of the DSP algorithms in action. Also include any code that you wrote or modified. Please do not include all of the boilerplate code from the textbook.
    
### IV. Discussion

In this section, discuss the takeaway from each lab. You can mention any intuition that you developed. Also mention any problems that you faced and how you rectified them.

### V. Assignment questions

Please answer the following questions.
