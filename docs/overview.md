# EE 445S Lab Component

As of Fall 2021, the instructions for the lab exercises will be entirely self contained in this lab manual.

The exercises now use the [STM32H735G Discovery Kit][1]. More information on the hardware is provided in Lab 1.

Prior to fall 2021, the laboratory component used the [OMAP-L138 Low-Cost Developer's Kit][2] (LCDK) and the following book

Thad B. Welch, Cameron H. G. Wright, and Michael G. Morrow, [Real-Time Digital Signal Processing from MATLAB to C with the TMS320C6x DSPs][3], CRC Press, 3rd ed., Jan. 2017, ISBN 978-1498781015.

This book is now optional, but you may find it helpful since the new exercises were adapted from it.


## Format of Lab
Each laboratory section meets three hours per week. Pre-laboratory quizzes are required for laboratories 2-6, and they are to be completed individually without help from anyone. For laboratory 1, the experiment and written report are to be completed individually. For laboratories 2-6, the experiment and report are to be completed in a team of two. For laboratory 7, which is optional, the experiment and oral report are to be completed individually. The format of the written lab report is described with each lab assignment.
