# Lab 5 Primer

The range of complexity for a pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) transceiver system can vary drastically. A working version that demonstrates the core principles can be simulated with just a few lines of code. In practice, many additional subsystems need to be added for reliable operation.

## Simulation

In simulation, pulse amplitude modulation is relatively straightforward, and can be achieved with just a handful steps.

### 1. Mapping data to pulses

The first step in any digital communication system is [serialization][1], the process of converting a useful data structure into a stream of bits. For example, the following MATLAB code serializes the ascii string "meatball" into an array of 56 bits.

```
>> serialized_data = reshape((dec2bin(uint8('meatball'))'),[1,56])

serialized_data =

    '11011011100101110000111101001100010110000111011001101100'

```

In 2-PAM, we map a bit of '0' to a pulse with an amplitude $-d$ and a bit of one to a pulse with an amplitude of $+d$. A common pulse shape is the [raised cosine][2]

```
upsampled_data = upsample(str2num(serialized_data')*2-1,16);
pulse_shaping_filter = rcosdesign(0.8,4,16,'normal');
sequence_of_pulses = conv(upsampled_data,pulse_shaping_filter,'same')
figure; plot(sequence_of_pulses); hold on; stem(upsampled_data.*max(pulse_shaping_filter));

```

### 2. Modulation and demodulation

The signal above is what we call the [baseband][3] signal. Before transmitting, we want shift the spectrum to higher frequencies in a way that can be reversed at the transmitter. A simple method is with sinusoidal modulation and demodulation

```
f0 = 12000; fs = 48000; w0 = 2*pi*f0/fs; n = 1:length(sequence_of_pulses);
modulated = sequence_of_pulses.' .* cos(w0*n);
figure; plot(sequence_of_pulses); hold on; plot(modulated);
```
![](../img/modulated.svg)

Demodulation can be achieved by once again multiplying by the carrier. The second multiplication by cosine introduces frequency components at $\pm f_c$, which can be removed by a low pass filter.

```
demodulated = modulated .* cos(w0*n);
recovered_pulses = conv(demodulated,pulse_shaping_filter,'same');
figure; plot(sequence_of_pulses); hold on; plot(recovered_pulses);
```

### 3. Mapping pulses to data

We end up with a signal that can be downsampled and quantized to recover the original data

```
>> recovered_data = downsample(recovered_pulses,16) > 0

recovered_data =

    '11011011100101110000111101001100010110000111011001101100'
```

## What could go wrong?

The example above demonstrates the most important techniques used in PAM. However, it leaves out many important steps.

### Transmitter

In the 2-PAM system described above, every bit of data required 16 samples to represent. If we want to transmit data at a respectable [bit rate][4], we need to ensure that each step is very efficient.

#### Polyphase filter bank for pulse shaping

Recall that we upsampled the data by a factor of $L$ before applying the pulse shaping filter. Using the standard FIR filter structure, this would mean that a large fraction, $\frac{L-1}{L}$, of the multiply-accumulate operations used in the filter are wasted on zeros! There are a variety of [techniques to increase the efficiency] by eliminating unnecessary multiply-by-zero operations. The most ubiquitous is the polyphase filter bank.

### Receiver

The receiver is where most of complexities occur. In the simulation above, we assumed that the receiver's carrier exactly matches the transmitter (both in frequency and phase). We assumed that the signal traveled from transmitter to receiver with no distortion or time delay. We also assumed that the transmitter and receiver have exactly the same sampling rates so that every symbol was separated by exactly 16 samples. Though these assumptions are rarely true in practice, each type of error can be addressed by adding an appropriate subsystem.

#### Costas loop for carrier recovery

The [Costas loop][5] is one way to track the phase $\theta$ using an iterative algorithm. When processing the $k$th sample at the receiver, the Costas loop produces the next phase estimate $\theta[k+1]$ based on the following rule:

$$ \theta[k+1] =  \theta[k] - \mu \text{LPF} \left\{ r[k] \cos(\omega_0 k + \theta[k])  \right\} \times \text{LPF} \left\{ r[k] \sin(\omega_0 k + \theta[k])  \right\}$$

where $r[k]$ is the received signal and $w_0$ is the carrier frequency.
